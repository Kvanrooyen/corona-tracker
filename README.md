This is a simple project that will enable you to view some of the stats for covid-19. The main idea behind this project was for me to improve my JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project you will need to clone it to your local machine, or download the [zip](https://github.com/Kvanrooyen/corona-tracker/archive/master.zip)

### Prerequists

You will need a few things installed on your machine before you can run the projecct, they are listed below:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

### Installing

Once you have installed Node and Gulp, we can then install the dependancies required. Open a terminal window in the root of the project folder, and run the following command.

`npm install`

You should then have everything installed. If you run `npm start` it should then open a browser window with the home page.
